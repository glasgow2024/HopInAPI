# HopInAPI

This is a Postman collection created to test against the HopIn API for assessing usng HopIn as a platform for Glasgow 2024.

To use:
* download the json file or clone the repo locally
* in Postman, go to Workspaces -> My Workspace -> Collections and click on import
* choose the json download to import the collection
* select the collection (not one of the requests) and under the Variables tab, set the apikey variable to the key shared by HopIn for testing purposes
  * if needs be, change the event name
 
Values for organisation, event, tickets are set from within the requests, so initially running the whole collection once should populate the values you need
